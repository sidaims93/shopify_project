[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/redis-mock.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/redis-mock/)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yeahoffline/redis-mock.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yeahoffline/redis-mock)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/yeahoffline/redis-mock/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/yeahoffline/redis-mock)

The goal of the `redis-mock` project is to create a feature-complete mock of [node_redis](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis), which may be used interchangeably when writing unit tests for code that depends on `redis`.

All operations are performed in-memory, so no Redis installation is required.

100% Redis-compatible (see [Cross Verification](#cross-verification))

# Cross verification

If you want to add new tests to the test base it is important that they work too on node_redis (we are creating a mock...).
You can therefore run the tests using `redis` instead of `redis-mock`. To do so:

````bash
$ make check-tests
````


You will need to have a running instance of `redis` on you machine and our tests use flushdb a lot so make sure you don't have anything important on it.
